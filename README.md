# Media App

I created this web application to test and implement what I have learnt so far about using API's. I have used the 
iTunes API to created a web app that allows users to search for all media types available in the iTunes store and 
add them to a favorites list.

This app was created using React for front end and Express for back end.

## Installation

1. To run this on your local machine, you need to clone this repository.
2. Install node modules by typing 'npm install' in /api for the back end and in /apple_store for the front end.
3. Then you need to navigate to /api and type 'node api.js' in the cmd line to start the back end server.
4. Lastly you need to type 'npm start' in /apple_store to start the react app.

## Security

This app makes use of Helmet for security.
